# Introduction

Until the moment I received the internship opportunity letter with the assignment attached to it, I had never worked with Spring Boot, React and JS, so I had to do a lot of research, wich I found quite exiting. As well, turned out, that my email marked your letter as spam, so I found it a week before the deadline. As I developed, I found more and more new methods to accomplish different tasks. You can see it during the code review. Now, with my new experience, I would have do my code differently, but unfortunately there is simply no time for this.
I'd like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to complete this challenge, as it's no exaggeration to say that I learned a lot on my own in the week I had to complete the task. I believe that this experience will help me to develop more successfully in this direction.
